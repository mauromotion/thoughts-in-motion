*An infinite roll of some nice new bands/musicians and album releases while I discover them.*

### James Holden - Imagine This Is A High Dimensional Space Of All Possibilities

A transcendental electronic journey beyond any genre classification. A freak lucid dream of positive only vibes. Gorgeous.

### Glyders - Maria's Hunt

A minimalist rock&roll album that still grooves hard thanks to its warm fuzzy tones and its swinging rhythm section. 

First gem of this new year discovered.

### A Place To Bury Strangers

I saw [A Place To Bury Strangers](https://www.aplacetoburystrangers.com/) live in 2017, they were opening for The Black Angels in Brixton.
I remember I was completely blown away, such an energetic performance. Their [new album](https://aplacetoburystrangers.bandcamp.com/album/see-through-you) has come out a few days ago and it's probably one of their best, at least to my taste.
But today on YT, while watching their latest music videos, I found another great KEXP live session from 2018. 

Mesmerized once again.

### Combo Chimbita

Today I was listening to the latest [Bandcamp Weekly](http://bandcamp.com/?show=520&play=1) episode and there was an interview with this band of Colombian New Yorkers called "Combo Chimbita". Their latest album [is out tomorrow](https://combochimbita.bandcamp.com/album/ire) and it was today's album of the day on Bandcamp. Their music was interesting, not usually my genre so I was a bit cautious to be honest.
Then I've searched for "Combo Chimbita live" on YouTube and I found this KEXP live session that absolutely blown me away!

Her voice and presence are stunning, from another space and time really. Synths, electric guitar that ranges from surf rock sounds to open distortion, South American rhythms. A powerful mix of modern and old that shines in the live performance.

Brilliant.
