Today I was listening to the latest [Bandcamp Weekly](http://bandcamp.com/?show=520&play=1) episode and there was an interview with this band of Colombian New Yorkers called "Combo Chimbita". Their latest album [is out tomorrow](https://combochimbita.bandcamp.com/album/ire) and it was today's album of the day on Bandcamp. Their music was interesting, not usually my genre so I was a bit cautious to be honest.
Then I've searched for "Combo Chimbita live" on YouTube and I found this KEXP live session that absolutely blown me away!

Her voice and presence are stunning, from another space and time really. Synths, electric guitar that ranges from surf rock sounds to open distortion, South American rhythms. A powerful mix of modern and old that shines in the live performance.

Brilliant.
