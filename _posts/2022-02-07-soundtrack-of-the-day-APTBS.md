I saw [A Place To Bury Strangers](https://www.aplacetoburystrangers.com/) live in 2017, they were opening for The Black Angels in Brixton.
I remember I was completely blown away, such an energetic performance. Their [new album](https://aplacetoburystrangers.bandcamp.com/album/see-through-you) has come out a few days ago and it's probably one of their best, at least to my taste.
But today on YT, while watching their latest music videos, I found another great KEXP live session from 2018. 

Mesmerized once again.
