## Update from May 23rd, 2024

### 💻 Work/Study

- Currently focused on building my new skills as a web developer.
- I'm finishing **CS50w**, gathering ideas for the "capstone" final project.
- Learning **React** and **Astro**, while planning to rebuild this website from scracth.
- As a brilliant procrastination strategy in the last couple of months I've retrained myself to touch type with a different keyboard layout, specifically [Colemak-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/). I'm at 50 wpm on average right now, and it is SO MUCH more comfortable and ergonomic than Qwerty. No regrets!

### 💪 Body

- I've been training with weights at the gym pretty constantly, three times per week since February, learning a lot in the process and feeling much better.
- Running-wise, after keeping a good streak of 100k per month this year, in May I had to slow it down because of some soreness in my right glute. Turns out, alternating gym and running 6 days a week at (almost) 44 years of young age could be asking a bit too much to myself.

## 🧠 Mind

### 🎵 Listening

- Recently I've got into this synthwave/crimewave/industrial rabbit hole, and I'm discovering so many good artists. My favourite has to be [IRVING FORCE](https://irvingforce.bandcamp.com/album/deep-clean-subdivision) though. And also [Street Cleaner](https://streetcleaner.bandcamp.com) is pretty good.

### 📖 Reading

- I haven't been reading much recently, I'm halfway through **Cory Doctorow's** - [The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/120806182-the-internet-con).

### 🎞️ Watching

- Really enjoyed the first season of the **Fallout** TV show.
- Now I'm back at finishing **30Rocks**, such a good show for light entertainment.
- The latest film I watched was [Perfect Days](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/976893-perfect-days) by **Wim Wenders**. A brilliant film, more akin to poetry than to prose, loved it.

### 🕹️ Playing

- I finally got into **Cyberpunk 2077** and I'm liking it so far.
- I keep trying to get into **Total War** strategy games but I just can't for some reason, they feel pretentiously complicated for what in fact they are. Also I find the Warhammer fantasy theme quite lame tbh.

### 🔭 Looking forward to...

- Hopefully the good season! It's been a long and wet winter here in England.
- Going to Italy for a couple of weeks next month.
- I've bought yet another keyboard! A [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) this time. Can't wait to literally put my hands on it.
