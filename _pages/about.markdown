My name is Mauro and I work as a motion designer, actually freelancing around London, UK. You can have a look at my portfolio here: [mauromotion.com](https://mauromotion.com).

See what I'm doing [now](/now).

### Music

I also have a lifelong passion for music, jazz and its round abouts in particular but I tend to discover interesting new stuff pretty often in various other genres.

### Mastodon

Along with my many interests I actually run a [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) server on [mograph.social](https://mograph.social). This is an experiment aimed at trying to build a space for motion designers, VFX artists and similar outside of the mainstream platforms like Twitter or Facebook and bring some visual excitment into the [Fediverse](https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse/).

### This website

The idea with this website is to create a repository of a few things I discover in any of the fields I'm interested in, be it motion design, music, privacy, PKM systems (Personal Knowledge Management).

Also, I might use this space to post some work in progress and experiments I do with moving (or static) images.

Overall, I wish this space to become a little piece of the web for myself in the spirit of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/).
