- Still living in SE London with my partner Flavia and our cat Jessy.

- Still freelancing from home since March 21st 2020.
- I'm not actually actively looking for new clients though, I'm just working for my regulars when they need me - in the meantime I'm studying various things to improve my career. Such as...
- Currently hard at work learning Houdini. I'm doing great progress, I don't feel like I'm a beginner anymore. Although, it's not super easy to kickstart my own projects with it (yet).
- Quite a lot of Octane tinkering - Redshift is still my main render engine but I finally managed to learn Octane as well.
- I took the online course "Design Bootcamp" from School of Motion to tackle once and for all my imposter syndrome. It was very intense but very much worth it.
- Working on various ideas for personal projects to develop further.

## For all the rest

- I'm dedicating way too much time into developing this blog. I think I'm addicted now.
- I'm very much interested in [PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) (Personal Knowledge Management), productivity, [Zettelkasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), [PARA method](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) (both of which I'm currently using), and the fantastic software that I'm constantly typing on for everything [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
- After a bad 2021 with injuries to both my ankle and my knee I'm finally back on track with running on a regular schedule. Actually last week I hit a personal record time on a 10K run at 54:49. Pretty good if you ask me!

#### Currently listening

- Looking forward to [Desertfest London 2022](https://www.desertfest.co.uk/), I've got the tickets in 2019. Hopefully this will be the year...
- Lots of electronic and IDM recently, mostly the classics Aphex Twin, Burial, Four Tet.
- For all the rest have a look [here](https://www.last.fm/user/madmonk80), and [here](https://bandcamp.com/mauromotion), and [here](https://blog.mauromotion.com/categories/#music).

#### Currently watching

- Watching for the first time The Sopranos, such a great show, I don't know why I haven't watched it before honestly. No spoilers please!

#### Currently playing

- Not much gaming for me recently but when I do play I'm mostly into roguelikes such as The Binding of Isaac and Dead Cells. // Elden Ring!

#### Currently reading

 Sitting on my bedside table:

- David Stubbs - Mars by 1980
